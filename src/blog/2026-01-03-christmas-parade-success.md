Downtown Ripley was transformed into a winter wonderland Saturday as the annual Christmas parade drew a record-breaking crowd estimated at over 5,000 spectators.

## Parade Highlights

This year's celebration featured more than 50 entries, including:

- **Ripley High School Marching Band** performing holiday favorites
- **Community floats** from local churches, businesses, and civic organizations
- **Classic cars** from the Tippah County Antique Auto Club
- **Youth groups** including scouts, dance teams, and sports leagues
- **Santa Claus** making his grand appearance on the final float

## Grand Marshal

This year's Grand Marshal was longtime educator and community volunteer Mrs. Dorothy Williams, who recently retired after 45 years of teaching in Tippah County schools.

"Being chosen as Grand Marshal is such an honor," Mrs. Williams said before the parade. "I've been attending this parade for decades, and it still fills my heart with joy to see our community come together."

## Best Float Awards

The parade judges selected the following winners:

- **Best Overall**: First United Methodist Church - "The Nativity Story"
- **Most Creative**: Ripley Garden Club - "Winter in Bloom"
- **Best Youth Entry**: Cub Scout Pack 107 - "Santa's Workshop"
- **Best Business**: Downtown Merchants Association - "Shop Local for the Holidays"

## Community Spirit

The event showcased the strong sense of community that defines Ripley, with families gathering along Main Street hours before the parade began.

"This is what small-town life is all about," said longtime resident Bob Anderson. "Three generations of my family are here today, just like when I was a kid."

## Looking Ahead

Mayor Thompson announced that next year's parade will introduce a new category for school entries and expand the route to accommodate growing crowds.

Mark your calendars: The 2026 Christmas parade is scheduled for the first Saturday in December.

*Thank you to all volunteers, participants, and spectators who made this year's parade the best ever!*
