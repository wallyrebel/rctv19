For 25 years, the aroma of fresh-baked bread and pastries has drawn customers to Mitchell's Bakery on Main Street. This month, owner Sarah Mitchell celebrates a quarter century of serving the Ripley community.

## A Family Tradition

Sarah Mitchell opened the bakery in January 2001 with a dream and her grandmother's recipes. What started as a small operation with just two employees has grown into a beloved community institution.

"My grandmother taught me that baking is about love," Sarah explains. "Every item we make carries that same love and attention to detail."

## Signature Items

The bakery has become famous for several specialties:

- **Grammy's Cinnamon Rolls** - Made from the original family recipe
- **Southern Pecan Pie** - A customer favorite for holidays
- **Fresh Sourdough Bread** - Baked fresh daily
- **Wedding Cakes** - Creating memories for local couples since 2003

## Community Connection

Beyond baking, Mitchell's has become a gathering place for the community. The cozy seating area hosts everything from business meetings to birthday celebrations.

"We're more than a bakery," Sarah says. "We're a place where neighbors become friends."

## Anniversary Celebration

To mark the milestone, Mitchell's Bakery is hosting a month-long celebration featuring:

- **Free coffee** with any pastry purchase on Saturdays in January
- **25% off** all specialty cakes ordered in January
- **Recipe cards** featuring Grammy's famous cinnamon roll recipe
- **Photo display** showcasing 25 years of community memories

## Looking Forward

Sarah has no plans to slow down. "As long as this community needs fresh bread and a friendly face, I'll be here," she promises.

The bakery is open Tuesday through Saturday, 6 AM to 3 PM.

*Congratulations to Sarah Mitchell and the entire Mitchell's Bakery team on 25 years of sweetening our community!*
