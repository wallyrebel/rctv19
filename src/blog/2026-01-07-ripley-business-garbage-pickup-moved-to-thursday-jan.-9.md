RIPLEY — Commercial garbage collection in the City of Ripley will be adjusted this week only, according to RES (Resourceful Environmental Services).

Businesses that are normally picked up on Fridays will instead be serviced on **Thursday, Jan. 9, instead of Friday, Jan. 10**. The change applies to businesses only and is not permanent.

RES asks business owners to place their carts out at the usual time, just one day earlier than normal.

Regular pickup schedules will resume next week.
