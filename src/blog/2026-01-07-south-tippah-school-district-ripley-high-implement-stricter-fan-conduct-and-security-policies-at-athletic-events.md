RIPLEY — The South Tippah School District and Ripley High School have announced a series of new and reinforced policies aimed at improving safety, sportsmanship and behavior at school-sponsored athletic events following several recent incidents involving inappropriate conduct by spectators and students.

In a statement released by the district this week, officials said they remain proud of the strong community support shown at sporting events but acknowledged that some recent behavior has not reflected the district’s values.

“Moving forward, the district will be much more intentional and firm in enforcing conduct expectations at all school-sponsored events,” the statement said.

The district emphasized that any disruptive, disrespectful, unsafe or unsportsmanlike behavior — including profanity, taunting, confrontations, or failure to follow event staff instructions — will not be tolerated. Immediate consequences may include removal from the event, loss of attendance privileges for future events, disciplinary action, and possible involvement of law enforcement when necessary.

In addition, congregating or loitering in common areas such as entrances, walkways, concession areas and restrooms is no longer permitted. Those areas must remain clear to ensure safety, accessibility and proper supervision, and spectators are expected to remain in designated seating areas unless entering or exiting the facility.

Alongside the districtwide statement, Ripley High School announced several specific game-day policy updates for events held at the Ripley Event Center.

Existing rules include:

• No loitering in the lobby area or outside the Event Center
• Fans are not allowed on the court
• Profanity will not be tolerated and good sportsmanship is required

Newly added policies include:

• Only clear bags will be allowed inside the Event Center
• All fans must pass through a security checkpoint upon entry
• Hoodies may not be worn over the head, and no garments may be worn that cover the face

School officials said the measures are intended to create a safe, respectful and enjoyable environment for students, families, staff and visiting teams.

Parents and guardians are encouraged to speak with students about appropriate behavior and help reinforce expectations.
