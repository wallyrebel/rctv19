RIPLEY, Miss. — Downtown Ripley shoppers will have a chance to take home a classic keepsake next month as Macs & Milli hosts silhouette artist Edward Casey for an afternoon of hand-cut portraits.

Casey will be at the shop Saturday, Feb. 7, from 1 to 4 p.m., creating traditional profile silhouettes — a paper-cut art style often used for children’s portraits and family mementos. Organizers say the portraits are intended as long-lasting gifts and memory pieces.
