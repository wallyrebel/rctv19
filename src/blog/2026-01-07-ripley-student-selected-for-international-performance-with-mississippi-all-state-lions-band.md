RIPLEY, Miss. — A Ripley student has been selected to perform on an international stage after earning a spot in the Mississippi All-State Lions Band.

Peyton Williams was recently chosen for the honor, which allows student musicians from across the state to represent Mississippi through performances and cultural exchange abroad.

Ripley Main Street is assisting with fundraising efforts to help cover travel and program expenses associated with the opportunity. All donations collected will be used solely for Williams’ band-related costs, and no funds will be retained by Ripley Main Street, organizers said.

Community members who wish to contribute can donate online through the official campaign link or by using the payment and mailing information listed on the event flyer. Those unable to donate are encouraged to share information about the fundraiser to help spread awareness.

Organizers said the selection is a significant achievement for Williams and an opportunity to represent both Ripley and Mississippi internationally.
