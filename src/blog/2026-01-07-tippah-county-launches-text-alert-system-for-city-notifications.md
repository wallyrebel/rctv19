RIPLEY, Miss. — Tippah County residents can now receive city-specific notifications by text message through a new alert system designed to deliver timely updates directly to their phones.

The county is using the TextMyGov platform to send alerts related to municipal services, public safety and other local information. Residents may opt in by texting a designated keyword for their city to the short code **91896**.

Available notification lists include:

- For Dumas notifications: text **“TIPPAH DUMAS”** to 91896
- For Blue Mountain notifications: text **“TIPPAH BLUE MOUNTAIN”** to 91896
- For Falkner notifications: text **“TIPPAH FALKNER”** to 91896
- For Ripley notifications: text **“TIPPAH RIPLEY”** to 91896
- For Walnut notifications: text **“TIPPAH WALNUT”** to 91896

After sending the initial keyword, users will receive a confirmation message and must reply “YES” to complete the opt-in process. Once confirmed, they will begin receiving text message notifications for that specific city.

County officials say residents may subscribe to more than one city list and may receive multiple messages depending on how many categories they choose to follow.

Standard message and data rates may apply, depending on the user’s mobile carrier. Residents can opt out of all alerts at any time by texting **STOP**.

Questions regarding individual alerts should be directed to the relevant city or town office rather than the county.

More information, including terms and privacy details, is available through the TextMyGov service.
