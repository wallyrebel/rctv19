The distribution will be held at the Walnut Fire Department, 27880 Highway 15 in Walnut. Organizers ask drivers to enter from the back of the fire department. A limit of three families per vehicle will be enforced, and participants are asked not to block driveways while waiting in line.

NMPHC said the pantry supports its mission to serve people in the community who need care the most but have the least access. The organization encouraged residents to follow its social media page for updates on future events and announcements.
