The Ripley City Council voted unanimously Monday evening to approve a comprehensive downtown development plan that city officials say will transform the heart of the community over the next five years.

## Key Highlights of the Plan

The development initiative includes several major components:

- **New mixed-use buildings** on Main Street featuring retail space on ground floors with residential apartments above
- **Streetscape improvements** including wider sidewalks, new lighting, and landscaping
- **Parking structure** to accommodate increased visitor traffic
- **Public plaza** for community events and farmers markets

## Economic Impact

Mayor James Thompson expressed enthusiasm about the project's potential. "This is a pivotal moment for Ripley," he said during the council meeting. "We're investing in our future while preserving the small-town character that makes our community special."

City economists project the development will create approximately 200 new jobs during construction and an additional 150 permanent positions once businesses are fully operational.

## Timeline

Construction is expected to begin in spring 2026, with the first phase completed by fall 2027. The entire project is slated for completion by 2030.

Residents can view the complete development plan at City Hall during regular business hours or online at the city's official website.

## Community Feedback

The council held three public hearings over the past two months, receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback from local business owners and residents.

"We've been waiting for something like this," said Sarah Mitchell, owner of Mitchell's Bakery on Main Street. "It will bring more foot traffic and help all of our downtown businesses thrive."
